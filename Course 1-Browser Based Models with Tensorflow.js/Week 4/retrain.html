So when we look at this function, we'll see that it tells the difference between buttons based off of their ID, which we can see is zero for rock, one for paper and two for scissors. We also named the divs that will be used for outputting the number of samples collected as rock samples, paper samples and scissor samples respectively ***********************************************-->

We'll do the same for stop predicting, and these methods will output to the div with predictions that we've just simply named 'prediction'. -->
