<!-- We run this using the 'Web Server for Chrome application'. There, we give the location of the directory containing the mobilenet.html and the image file. Then click on the URL in the Web Server for Chrome application (http://127.0.0.1:8887). Then when the folder directory opens in chrome, we click on the mobilenet.html file to run it. 

If we just open it by double clicking the file in file explorer, it won't work-->

            //This will show us the class name(cofee/expresso/cup/table..) and the probability that the image matches that class.
            //However, the sum of probabilties for the different classes don't add up to 1. This is because there are a 1000 classes and the sum of probabilities of all 1000 of them add up to 1, but the console doesn't print all 1000 of them, it justs prints the top 3
