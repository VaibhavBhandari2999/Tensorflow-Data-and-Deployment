We'll learn how to take a model that's been trained in TensorFlow in Python and run that in a web browser, in TensorFlow.js.
Today, a lot of models are still trained in a data center using TensorFlow, so how do we run that in a browser.
There's actually a suite of tools in TensorFlow called TensorFlow.js in Python that you can use to then convert your TensorFlow saved models into JSON notation.

This week 2 models are considered. One is a model for sentence toxicity, other one is Mobilenet for image classification.
Mobilenet is designed to run on low resource environments, but its good to train it on a big data center, convert it and then use it on a browser. This is good for privacy and saving round-trips

In week 1 and 2, we learnt how to run models in the browser, use images to train a CNN on them, visualization libraries, combine many images into 1 to save opning many HTTP connections, tf.tidy() etc.
This week, we're going to use existing models, not training them on our own, a lot of them are available open source. We'll also see some scripts that convert the pre-trained model into a format which is usable by JS.

The models are located at https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models. There are imae classifiers, audio-speech recognition and even some text utilities.
Today, we are using the toxicity classifier which detects whether text contains threats, obscenities, insults etc. It was trained on 2 million English comments which were already labeled in this way.

Its located at https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity

let's take a look at another image classification library called MobileNet. 
MobileNet is a small low-latency, low-power model, parameterized to meet the resource constraints of a variety of use cases. 
There are several versions but they can be built upon for classification, detection, embeddings, and other segmentation similar to how other popular large-scale models, such as Inception are used. 

MobileNets trade-off between latency, size, and accuracy while comparing favorably with popular state of the art models. 
MobileNets are trained to recognize a thousand classes, and at http://bit.ly/mobilenet-labels OR http://www.laurencemoroney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/labels.txt the supported classes are mentioned

We run this using the 'Web Server for Chrome application'. There, we give the location of the directory containing the mobilenet.html and the image file. 
Then click on the URL in the Web Server for Chrome application (http://127.0.0.1:8887). Then when the folder directory opens in chrome, we click on the mobilenet.html file to run it.
If we just open it by double clicking the file in file explorer, it won't work

We saw existing pre-trained models that became very easy for you to use in JavaScript in the browser. 
In this part, we'll see how to build them, train them using Python, and then convert them into JavaScript using tooling.

We'll build the very basic NN we built in week 1 where we fit numbers to each other in a relationship where y=2x-1

The NN is only 1 layer, with 1 unit trained with stochastic gradient descent and MSE loss.
We give input as 6 X vaues and 6 Y values and train it for 500 epochs.
Then we give it a X value (10.0) for it to predict the Y value

We now have to save the model. We do that using a timestamp. So we'll import time, get the current time stamp, and save the model and the path /tmp/saved_models/ followed by the timestamp. 
Then we use a command to convert a saved model,previously saved in tensorflowjs format, and its called model.json

SEE THIS VIDEO AGAIN LATER. ITS THE 4MIN VIDEO IN THE 3RD WEEK OF THE COURSE 'BROWSER BASED MODELS WITH TENSORFLOW JS'

All this is in the ipynb file.

After saving the model, open the linear.html file in the same directory as the ipynb file.
