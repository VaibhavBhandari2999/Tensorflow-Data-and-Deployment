Architecture of tensorflow.js

Its designed to run in the browser and a Node.js server

						TF-CPU	TF-GPU    TF-TPU

Layers API is friendly high level API like keras API in tensorflow, but we use JS instead of python
The Core APIs are the low level APIs, designed to work with Tensorflow saved model format, which can be used across Python APIs, JS APIs and even Tensorflow Lite APIs

The Core API then works with the browser, and can take advantage of WebGL for accelerated trainingand inference

Also, on Node.js, we can build server side or terminal applications using it. These can take advantage of CPUs/GPUs/TPUs depending on your machine
