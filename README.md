# Tensorflow-Data-and-Deployment

Bringing a machine learning model into the real world involves a lot more than just modeling. This Specialization will show how to navigate various deployment scenarios and use data more effectively to train a model.

<h2>Setting Up<h/2>

You will need to have an internet browser, an HTML editor, and a web server installed on your machine to run the examples and exercises. We recommend you use Chrome as your internet browser, Brackets as your HTML editor and the Web Server for Chrome App as your web server. All of these are free and are available for various platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

<h3>Course 1 - Browser based Models with Tensorflow.js</h3>

The exercise and example in Week 3 of thi course also contains a Jupyter Notebook. To run this notebook you will need have installed Jupyter with Python 3, TensorFlow 2.0, Tensorflowjs, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
